# WW2 Marianas Sandbox

So far a rudimentary flight area for the Corsair.

Orote Field: 4 client slots
CV-11 Intrepid: 4 cold client slots, 2 hot client slots

Parked aircraft and vehicles for gunnery at Rota Field. 

AI Corsair orbiting along Guam SE coast for formation practice (5000ft MSL, 200KCAS, left orbit)

CV-11 is set to auto-turn into the wind at 1 minute after mission start, continuing for 4 hours with 30kts over the deck. Changing mission time will disable this, so if you change mission time open the .miz file and edit the turn-into-wind lua file timings.
Launch/Recovery static templates are selected through the comms F10 menu.
