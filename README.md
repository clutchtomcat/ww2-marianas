# WW2 Marianas Sandbox v1.0 Beta
Endless sandbox for Corsairs and Thunderbolts with random-spawn ground units and AI conducting cyclical air support, interdiction, and other missions for an 8-hour period. 
## Do NOT choose a slot until mission time is 10:03 or scripts will not run!

### Situation
The Allies have achieved air superiority over the Marianas and have begun the invasions of Saipan and Guam, however Rota and Tinian are still under Japanese control. CV-13, with VF-5 and VMF-214 embarked, is tasked with strikes on Rota while HMS Illustrious of the British Pacific Fleet is responsible for targets on Tinian. On Guam, ground forces have split the island in two, with the enemy cornered on the northern and southern areas of the island. Orote and Agana have been repaired and are operational, with MAG-21 conducting air support out of Agana. On Saipan, Kanoa and Isley airfields have been secured. The AAF's 318th Fighter Group is bearing the brunt of air support operations in central and northern Saipan. 

The mission starts at 0959 hrs, with the first event of the day launching at 1002 hrs. Subsequent events follow every hour on the hour. The first three events of the day are focused on attacking enemy airfields and air defenses with simultaneous close air support and interdiction. Tasking then pivots to prioritize close air support and interdiction. Last event launches at 1700 hrs, and flight operations should cease by 1830 hrs. Friendly armor is scattered across the FLOT and may engage with enemy units. ID your targets to avoid fratricide.

Viable targets are as follows:
- All merchant shipping
- Aircraft, vehicles, and infrastructure at enemy airfields: Rota, Ushi, Airfield-3, and Marpi
- Air defenses at Rota and Tinian harbors
- Random-spawn ground units of Japanese tanks, logistics vehicles, and AAA trucks.
